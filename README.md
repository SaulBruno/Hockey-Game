# Hockey-Game

This is the final project I completed for the Google-Sponsored Computer Science Computing Initiative (CSSI). I collaborated with Jose Esquivel and Stephanny Martinez ( I do not know their Github name, apologies). 

We used the p5 javascript library to build a hockey game. It's a simple hockey game in which two players try to score goals on eachother. The player on the right moves with the arrow keys while the player on the left moves with the WASD keys. You have to click on the screen for the game to begin. 

If you would like to set up and run this project, you can download the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.
